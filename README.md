# FAQ

## 1. Game installation failed?
QRookie currently does not support `install.txt`. Some games may fail to install or may not run after installation. You can find the downloaded games in `~/.var/app/io.github.glaumar.QRookie/data/QRookie/` and manually install them ([Manual-Sideloading](https://vrpirates.wiki/en/Howto/Manual-Sideloading)).

## 2. Are all the games provided by QRookie? Are these games infected with viruses?

No, QRookie does not provide any games. It is just a downloader that downloads games from public servers. QRookie does not know what it is downloading, and it does not check whether the downloaded content is a legitimate game or a virus. **To ensure the safety of your VR device, please do not use QRookie** .
